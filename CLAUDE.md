# riverwatcher

Part of the riktom.com app suite. See https://github.com/riktom-com/handbook for full venture docs.


## Standardized Nav (rk-nav)

This app uses the shared riktom.com nav block (scoped `.rk-*` classes, self-contained CSS) that is identical across all 11 riktom.com properties. The block is enclosed by marker comments:

```
<!-- rk-nav:start -->
... nav HTML + scoped style ...
<!-- rk-nav:end -->
```

**To update the nav site-wide** (add a new app, change a link, restyle):
1. Edit `/tmp/patch_navs.py` on the VPS (or `/tmp/sync/patch_local.py` for local repos) with the new HTML.
2. Re-run the patcher — it finds the markers and replaces the block in place. The replace is idempotent.
3. For repos with React/Vite builds (e.g. fire-watcher), re-patch after rebuild since `dist/index.html` is regenerated.
